        <h2>What is CGPA?</h2>
        <p>CGPA, or Cumulative Grade Point Average, is a grading system commonly used by various educational institutions to assess the overall academic performance of a student. It is calculated by averaging the grade points of all the subjects over several semesters. The CGPA scale usually ranges from 0 to 10, with 10 representing the highest academic performance.</p>
        <p>For example, if a student earns a CGPA of 8.0, it indicates that the student's overall performance across all semesters averages out to 8.0 on a scale of 10.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Why Convert CGPA to Percentage?</h2>
        <p>There are multiple reasons why students might need to convert their CGPA into a percentage:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>University Requirements</strong>: Many universities, especially those outside India, often require percentage-based grades for admission.</li>
            <li><strong>Job Applications</strong>: Some employers or organizations prefer evaluating a candidate's academic performance in percentage format, making the conversion important.</li>
            <li><strong>Comparative Performance</strong>: If a student wishes to compare their academic performance with those who have been graded using percentage scales, converting CGPA into percentage becomes necessary.</li>
            <li><strong>Tracking Academic Progress</strong>: Converting CGPA to percentage helps students track their academic performance and provides a clearer understanding of how well they are performing over the years.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Convert CGPA to Percentage?</h2>
        <p>Converting CGPA to percentage is straightforward. There are several methods used by different institutions, but the most common one is multiplying the CGPA by 9.5. This is based on the general conversion formula widely used across various Indian universities.</p>
        <p><strong>Formula:</strong><br>
        <code>Percentage = CGPA × 9.5</code></p>
        <p>For instance, if a student has a CGPA of 8.0, the percentage would be:</p>
        <p><strong>Percentage = 8.0 × 9.5 = 76%</strong></p>
        <p>However, it's important to note that some universities use slightly different conversion formulas. For example, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) in India uses the same formula, but other institutions like Gujarat Technological University (GTU) or Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU) might have their own specific formulas.</p>

        <h3>Conversion for Different Scales:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For a 10-point scale:</strong> Multiply the CGPA by 9.5.</li>
            <li><strong>For a 4-point scale:</strong> Multiply the CGPA by 25.</li>
            <li><strong>For a 5-point scale:</strong> Multiply the CGPA by 20.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Examples of CGPA to Percentage Conversion</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>CGPA of 8.5 on a 10-point scale:</strong><br>

            <li><strong>CGPA of 3.6 on a 4-point scale:</strong><br>
            Percentage = 3.6 × 25 = <strong>90%</strong></li>
            <li><strong>CGPA of 4.2 on a 5-point scale:</strong><br>
